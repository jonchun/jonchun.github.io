# The Art of Asking for Help

When faced with a problem, the way you ask for help can determine whether you receive a quick solution or end up waiting days for a response (if you get one at all). Knowing how to ask for help effectively is both an art and a skill -- one that can be learned like any other. With a decade of experience both seeking help from others and answering questions as a subject matter expert, Iâ€™d like to share what Iâ€™ve learned.

There's plenty of content on this very topic. This blog post is simply my take on it based on my own experiences.

## The Problem Statement

In most situations, you should be able to distill your issue into a clear and concise problem statement. While it may not cover every detail or nuance, having a focused problem statement helps direct your request for help more effectively. If you find that a single statement doesnâ€™t seem sufficient, it could be a sign that you're actually dealing with multiple issues. In such cases, it may be more effective to break your concerns into separate, distinct requests to ensure that each one is addressed properly.

!!! failure "Bad Example"

    > My email doesn't work.

!!! success "Good Example"

    > My email client is stuck on 'Syncing' and hasnâ€™t updated in the past 24 hours.

This statement often makes a great title for an email, support ticket, or service request.

## Do Your Homework

The most effective way to ask for assistance is to first make an effort to help yourself. Before seeking guidance, take a moment to assess the situation and explore possible solutions on your own.

Imagine you're riding in a car with a friend who is driving. They have a navigation app open, clearly displaying the route, yet they keep turning to you every 15 seconds to ask where they should go next. The information they need is already available to them... they just arenâ€™t using it.

The same principle applies when seeking help in any situation. Whether you're tackling a work problem, learning a new skill, or troubleshooting an issue, taking the time to check available resources first (instructions, guides, past experiences, etc) makes a significant difference. It not only saves time for both you and the person assisting you, but also empowers you to become more self-sufficient over time.

By showing that youâ€™ve made an effort before asking for help, you demonstrate respect for others' time and a willingness to learn, which makes people more inclined to assist you.

## Provide Context

When asking for help, context is key. No one can read your mind, so be sure to include relevant details about your problem. Organize and format your information clearly. No one will sift through thousands of lines of log files for you. Do your best to include only the most relevant details, and if you're unsure, you can always add extra information in a follow-up message or a separate section at the end.

Include information such as:

-   The steps you've taken and their results
    -   This is your opportunity to demonstrate that **you** care about solving your own problem. If you're not willing to put in the effort to address it, why would anyone else be motivated to help you? Don't send the message that the issue isnâ€™t important to you.
    -   Consider trying [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). It works even for problems unrelated to code!
-   Your end goal, not just the immediate problem (See [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/))
-   System specifications, error messages, and other details
    -   A picture is worth a thousand words. Include screenshots or video whenever possible.
-   Relevant code or configurations (Even better is a [Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example))
    -   I often find that when I recreate a minimal example in order to ask my question, I often end up resolving the issue myself.

!!! failure "Bad Example (Not enough context)"

    > I can't login please help

!!! success "Good Example"

    > I'm receiving an 'Invalid Credentials' error when I try to log in to my account using my email (example@email.com) and correct password. This started happening today after I reset my password. I've tried clearing my browser cache and using a different browser, but the issue persists. I'm using Google Chrome on Windows 10.
    >
    > ðŸ“¸ Attached is a screenshot of my issue.

Note how the request for help isn't even very long. It simply includes the following:

-   Specific Error Message
-   When the issue started
-   Troubleshooting steps taken
-   Environment details such as OS and Browser
-   Screenshot of problem

This initial level of detail allows someone to jump in and offer help without having to ask basic questions, saving time for everyone involved. It also demonstrates that you've put thought into the problem and aren't just looking for someone to do the work for you.

!!! Note

    While you don't want to overwhelm with unnecessary information, it's better to provide slightly too much context than too little. Experts can skim past extra details, but they can't help at all without information!

## Use Proper Formatting

Take the time to properly format your request for help. **NOBODY** wants to read a wall of text.

-   Use bullet points and headers to break up information
-   Format your code with appropriate code blocks for clarity
-   Include inline images whenever possible
-   Make your request easy to read and navigate!
-   Having trouble? Use AI assistants such as ChatGPT or Claude for help!

## Be Patient and Professional

Would **you** want to help someone who is being rude? Whether you're asking for help online, at work, or from friends, always approach the situation with politeness and respect. Keep in mind that you're asking someone to take time out of their day to assist you because you weren't able to resolve the issue on your own.

If you do end up finding the solution yourself, it's common courtesy to share it with others. If you end up receiving assistance, be sure to pay it forward by helping others in the future!

## Always Remember...

When you take the time to craft thoughtful, well-structured questions, you create value that extends beyond just your specific situation.

-   The better you ask your question, the better answers you'll receive
-   Good questions help others learn too. When you document clearly, you create a resource that others who encounter the same issue can also use in the future.
-   Building a reputation for asking good questions makes people more likely to help you in the future

Mastering the art of asking for help is a valuable skill that will benefit you throughout your career and life. By following these guidelines, you'll not only receive better answers but also demonstrate respect for the time and expertise of those assisting you.
