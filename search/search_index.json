They're great for answering direct questions but not ideal for handling complex, multi-step tasks.</p> <p>One major limitation most people run into immediately is lack of memory and context retention. LLMs don\u2019t naturally remember past interactions, meaning you have to repeatedly provide context, which can be frustrating and inefficient. </p> <p>Another common issue is lack of initiative. LLMs respond to prompts but don\u2019t proactively take action or follow up on tasks unless explicitly told to. This makes them more like a search engine than an intelligent assistant that truly \"gets things done.\"</p> <p>There\u2019s also the challenge of orchestration. If a task involves multiple steps -- like researching, summarizing, making decisions, and executing actions, LLM's struggle to autonomously manage the workflow. They rely entirely on the user to break tasks into chunks, provide structured inputs, and manually guide the process.</p> <p>They also lack built-in tooling and the ability to act. While they can generate code, suggest solutions, or analyze data, they can\u2019t directly interact with the internet, with API's, with code, etc. without additional layers of infrastructure.</p> <p>The possibilities are immense.

You're chatting with ChatGPT, and it seems to remember your entire conversation, almost magically tracking the context of your discussion until it suddenly doesn't know what you're talking about.</p> <p>Here's the catch -- under the hood, these models are actually severely limited. They literally don't naturally remember anything. All the model itself knows how to do is predict the next token (a rough proxy for the next word) in the conversation given the previous tokens. So how do they pull off that seamless conversation?</p> <p>This is where agents come into play. They are the secret sauce that turns a raw AI model into a smart, adaptive assistant. Think of an agent like a personal assistant wrapped around an LLM. It's not just about responding to questions; it's about understanding context, managing memory, and actually getting things done. These agents are like translators, interpreters, and problem-solvers all rolled into one.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Conversation History: This is a fundamental mechanism in agent systems where all messages exchanged between a user and an AI model are sequentially tracked. When a new message arrives, the agent adds it to the existing conversation log and then submits the complete history to the model for generating a contextually informed response. This is important! Every single time you send another message in a long conversation, the model is rereading your entire conversation! </p> </li> <li> <p>Tool Integration: Agents aren't just confined to generating text. They can connect to web searches, execute code, interact with APIs, and perform complex tasks. Imagine having an assistant that doesn't just talk about writing a script, but can actually write and run it for you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Proactive Problem Solving: Instead of waiting for explicit instructions, advanced agents can break down complex tasks, identify necessary steps, and even adjust their approach if something doesn't work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Memory: They can store and retrieve previous conversation details, context, and even learn from past interactions. It's like giving an agent a notebook and the ability to flip back through its pages. </p> </li> </ul> <p>The result? An AI that feels less like a fancy autocomplete and more like a genuine assistant -- one that understands your intent, remembers your context, and can actually help you accomplish real-world tasks. It's not just about answering questions or predicting the next output anymore. It's about creating an intelligent system that can reason, plan, and execute -- bringing us closer to the dream of a true AI companion.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/why-use-an-agentic-framework/#what-are-agentic-frameworks","title":"What Are Agentic Frameworks?","text":"<p>Agentic frameworks are the structured systems and architectures that enable AI agents to operate intelligently, flexibly, and efficiently.
